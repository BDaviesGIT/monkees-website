              <h2>Who are The Monkees?</h2>
              <p> Founded in Los Angeles in 1965, the monkees are an American rock band who where formed for the American Television series "The Monkees". Though initially, the band was restricted in what they where able to do in the recording studio due to commitments to the television show, the band fought for the right to control and supervise their musical output and eventually won through. In 1968, the TV show was cancelled, however dispite this the band was able to split off and continue recording. </p>
              <p> Since then, the band has continued to release albums and tour. Though they began as a fictional band for the television series, they have sold more then 75 million records world wide, producing a number of international hits and even outselling the Rolling Stones and The Beatles at their peak. Furthermore, they where one of the first artists to achieve number one hits in both the USA and UK at the same time and in May 2016, recieved an Outstanding Achievement award, celibrating their 50th anniversary.
